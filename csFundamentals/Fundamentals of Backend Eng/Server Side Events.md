The lifecycle of an SSE typically involves the following steps:

1.  Connection initiation: The client sends a request to the server to establish an SSE connection. The request is typically made using the EventSource API in JavaScript, which creates a new EventSource object that represents the connection to the server.
    
2.  Server response: Upon receiving the SSE request, the server responds with a standard HTTP response, but with a special MIME type of "text/event-stream". This tells the client that it's an SSE connection and that the server will be sending events in a specific format.
    
3.  Event streaming: Once the SSE connection is established, the server starts sending events to the client as a continuous stream of text data. Each event is represented as a separate text block, preceded by a "data:" field, followed by the event data. The server can send multiple events in the same response, separated by newlines.
    
4.  Event handling: On the client side, the EventSource API listens for events and triggers the appropriate event handlers in JavaScript when new events are received. The client can access the event data and perform actions accordingly, such as updating the user interface or processing the event data.
    
5.  Connection maintenance: The SSE connection remains open until it's explicitly closed by either the client or the server. The client can also specify a "retry" interval in the SSE request, which tells the server how long to wait before sending a "ping" event to keep the connection alive. If the connection is lost, the client can automatically attempt to reconnect and re-establish the SSE connection.
    
6.  Connection termination: The SSE connection can be closed by either the client or the server. The client can close the connection by calling the `close()` method on the EventSource object, or the server can close the connection by sending a special event with the "event" field set to "close". Upon receiving a close event, the client should handle the event and close the SSE connection gracefully.
    

That's the basic lifecycle of a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection. It's a simple and efficient way to push real-time updates from the server to the client over a single HTTP(S) connection without the need for frequent polling.
