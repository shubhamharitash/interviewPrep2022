Proxy and reverse proxy are two related but distinct concepts used in computer networks and web communication. They both act as intermediaries between clients and servers, but they differ in their roles and functions.

1.  Proxy: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. When a client makes a request to access a resource (such as a website or a file) from a server, the proxy server receives the request on behalf of the client and forwards it to the server. The server responds to the proxy server, which then forwards the response back to the client. The client and server are unaware of each other's existence. Proxies are commonly used for tasks such as caching, content filtering, load balancing, and security purposes (such as hiding the client's IP address).

2.  Reverse Proxy: A reverse proxy server, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary between clients and servers from the perspective of the server. When a client makes a request to access a resource, the reverse proxy server receives the request on behalf of the server. The reverse proxy server then forwards the request to one or more servers behind it, based on configured rules or algorithms, and receives the response. The response is then forwarded back to the client. From the client's perspective, it appears as if the response came directly from the reverse proxy server. Reverse proxies are commonly used for tasks such as load balancing, SSL termination, authentication, and caching.

In summary, a proxy acts as an intermediary from the client's perspective, while a reverse proxy acts as an intermediary from the server's perspective. Proxies are used to protect and enhance the client's connection to the server, while reverse proxies are used to protect and enhance the server's connection to the client. Both proxies and reverse proxies play important roles in modern networking and web communication, and their specific use cases depend on the requirements of the system or application being used.
