#### Note
1) Graph with no cycles -> Trees
![[Graph-1678923502684.jpeg]]
2) **Degree** -> number of edges incident on a vertex
![[Graph-1678923667609.jpeg]]
3) **Subgraph** -> Subset of graph edges
4) **Path** -> Sequence of adjacent vertices
5) **Cycle** -> A path where first and last vertices are the same
6) **Connected Graph** -> A graph which has a path from every vertex to every other vertex
7) **Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)** -> Directed graph with no cycles
8) **Forest** -> Disjoint set of trees
9) **Spanning Tree** -> Connected graph with all vertices of graph and is a tree
10) **Bipartite Graph** -> A graph where vertices can be divided into two sets where each vertex of one set connects with all vertices of other set

11) **Complete Graph** -> Graph with all edges present
12) **Sparse graphs** -> Graphs with relatively few edges (Generally less than VlogV)
