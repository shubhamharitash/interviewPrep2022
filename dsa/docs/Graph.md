## [[Important Terms]]

## Graph representations
1) [[Adjacency Matrix]]
2) [[Adjacency List]]
3) [[Adjacency Set]] -> More efficient, instead of set HashMap can also be used to optmize graph representation more. but removals from HashMap is costly.
4) Edge List -> simple a list of all edges

## Traversals

1) [[DFS(Depth first search)]]
	1) [[Topological Sort]]
	2) [[Strongly connected components]]
2) [[BFS(Breadth first search)]]
	1) [[Topological Sort]]

## Shortest Path Algorithms
1) [[Shortest Path in unweighted graph]]
2) [[Shortest Path in weighted graph(Dijikstra)]]
3) [[Shortest Path in weighted graph with negative edges]]
	1) [[Bellman ford]]
4) [[All Pair Shortest Path(Floyd Warshall's Algorithm)]]

## Minimum Spanning Tree
1) [[Prim's algorithm]]
2) [[Kruskal's algorithm]]

## Problems
![[Graph-1679223324584.jpeg]]
>**Q: Earlier in this chapter, we discussed minimum spanning tree algorithms. Now,
>give an algorithm for finding the maximum-weight spanning tree in a graph?**
>->Maximum Weight Spanning Tree = Minimum weight spanning tree with negative weights.

1) [[All Paths from source to destination]]
2) [[Articulation Points]]
3) [[Cut Bridges]]
