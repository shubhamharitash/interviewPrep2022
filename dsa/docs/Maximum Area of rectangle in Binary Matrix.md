## Problem Statement
Here we are given a binary matrix, we need to compute maximum area of rectangle in that matrix
**I/P**
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 

**O/P**: 8 since we can form maximum rectangle size of 8 only.

## Approaches
#### Approach 1

We brake 2d matrix to single 1d array. We know how to solve [[Maximum Area of Histogram]] for 1d array. That will be applied for different dimensions.

###### Code
```java
