#### Logic
The elements required to the left are always swapped with partition index
comparision is performed for whether current is on left
	if true it is swapped with ele at part_index since it always points to element at right
partition_index stays stuck at elements required on right(if there is a element for right)

#### Usage
can be used whenever we have a comparision function for a particular index in array, elements need to be divided on the basis of that
