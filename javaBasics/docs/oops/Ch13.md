## Abstract Classes and Interfaces

#### Important Points regarding abstract classes

###### All the abstract methods must be implemented
> An abstract method cannot be contained in a nonabstract class. If a subclass of an abstract superclass does not implement all the abstract methods, the subclass must be defined as abstract. In other words, in a nonabstract subclass extended from an abstract class, all the abstract methods must be implemented. 

###### abstract methods are nonstatic
> Also note that abstract methods are nonstatic. 

###### Not instantiated but constructors can be defined
> An abstract class cannot be instantiated using the new operator, but you can still define its constructors, which are invoked in the constructors of its subclasses. For instance, the constructors of GeometricObject are invoked in the Circle class and the Rectangle class. 

###### Abstract class != class which always has abstract methods
>A class that contains abstract methods must be abstract. However, it is possible to define an abstract class that doesn’t contain any abstract methods. In this case, you cannot create instances of the class using the new operator. This class is used as a base class for defining subclasses. 

###### subclass can override a method from its superclass to define it as abstract
>A subclass can override a method from its superclass to define it as abstract. This is very unusual, but it is useful when the implementation of the method in the superclass becomes invalid in the subclass. In this case, the subclass must be defined as abstract. 

###### subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete
>A subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete. For example, the Object class is concrete, but its subclasses, such as GeometricObject, may be abstract. 

###### Can't create instances but can be used as a data type
>You cannot create an instance from an abstract class using the new operator, but an abstract class can be used as a data type. Therefore, the following statement, which creates an array whose elements are of the GeometricObject type, is correct.

###### Cloneable interface
The Cloneable interface specifies that an object can be cloned
```java
public class CloneableHouse implements Cloneable{  
    String houseName;  
  
    public CloneableHouse(String houseName) {  
        this.houseName = houseName;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public CloneableHouse clone() {  
        try {  
            return (CloneableHouse) super.clone();  
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {  
            throw new AssertionError();  
        }  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "CloneableHouse{" +  
                "houseName='" + houseName + '\'' +  
                '}';  
    }  
}
```
