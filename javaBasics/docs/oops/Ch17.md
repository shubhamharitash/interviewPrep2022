## Binary I/O

A file that can be processed (read, created, or modified) using a text editor such as Notepad on Windows or vi on UNIX is called a **text file**. All the other files are called **binary files**.

#### What is a binary file?

>A binary file is a file whose content is in a binary format consisting of a series of sequential [bytes](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/byte), each of which is eight [bits](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/bit-binary-digit) in length.

#### Pros and Cons to binary file
###### Pros
1) More efficient than text files since its does not envolve encoding and decoding.

###### Cons
1) Is not human readable.

When you read a byte using binary I/O, one byte value is read from the input.

#### Binary I/O Classes

**InputStream**: for input of binary files
**OutputStream**: for output of binary files

The expression ((value = input.read()) != -1) (line 20) reads a byte from input.read(), assigns it to value, and checks whether it is –1. The input value of –1 signifies the end of a file.

>**Note**: The AutoClosable interface defines the close() method that closes a resource. Any object of the AutoClosable type can be used with the try-with-resources syntax for automatic closing.

###### Writing array of content using object stream

#### Serializable Interface
Its an interface which needs to be implemented if an object needs to be written or read from output and input streams respectively.

#### transient keyword
it tells the JVM to ignore a field to be written to outputstream while that object is being written to disk.
