## Object Oriented Thinking

#### Abstraction
>It can be defined as seperation of class implementation from the use of the class.

Eg:
```mermaid
classDiagram
	class Vehicle{
		+ move()
		+ stop()
	}
	<<Interface>> Vehicle
	class Car {
		-int wheels
		-String action
		+Car()
		+move()
		+stop()
	}
	Car <|-- Vehicle : implements
```

Here, **Vehicle** interface provides the necessary methods which needs to be implemented by any class which is implementing the **Vehicle** interface.

#### Encapsulation
> It can be defined as wrapping up of data into single unit, providing only necessary details for use to client.

Eg:
```mermaid
classDiagram
	class Account {
		-int id
		-double balance
		-double annualInterestRate = 0
		-Date dateCreated
		+Account()
		+getId()
		+getBalance()
		+getAnnualInterestRate()
		+getdateCreated()
		+setId()
		+setBalance()
		+setAnnualInterestRate()
		+getMonthlyInterestRate()
		+getMonthlyInterest()
		+withdraw(double amount)
		+deposit(double amount)
	}
```

In **Account** class, the **data members** are hidden from the user and are only exposed with the help of **public** **getters** and **setters**.

#### Class relationships

###### Association
> It defines a general relationship between classes which can be one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many

```mermaid
classDiagram
	class Student {
		-Course[] courseList
		+addCourse(Course course)
	}
	class Course {
		-Student[] studentList
		-Faculty faculty
		+addStudent(Student s)
		+setFaculty(Faculty faculty)
	}
	class Faculty {
		-Course[] courseList
		+addCourse(Course course)
	}
	Student "5..60" --> "*" Course : "takes"
	Faculty "1" --> "0..3" Course : "teaches"
```

###### Aggregation
> Denotes **has-a** relationship
> Child class can exist independently of parent
> Eg: Student has an address, Bank has an employee

```mermaid
classDiagram
	class Student {
		-Address address
		-Name name
	}
	class Address {
		-Student[] studentList
	}
	class Name {
		-Student student
	}
	Student "1..3" o-- "1" Address
	Student "1" *-- "1" Name
```
**Note:** Aggregation can exist between objects of the same class
```mermaid
classDiagram
	Person "1" o-- "m" Person : Supervisor
```

###### Composition
> Denotes **part-of** relationship
> Child class can't exist independently of parent
> If a composite is deleted, all other parts associated with it are deleted.
> Eg: name is a part of student, heart is a part of human

```mermaid
classDiagram
	Human "1" *-- "1" Heart
```

###### Inheritance
> Denotes **is-a** relationship

```mermaid
classDiagram
	Car --|> Vehicle : "is-a"
	Scooter --|> Vehicle : "is-a"
	Bike --|> Vehicle : "is-a"
```
