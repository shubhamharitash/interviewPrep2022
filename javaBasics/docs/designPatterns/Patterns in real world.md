#### How to use patterns?
1) KISS -> Keep it simple
	1) Final goal is to make things easy for us, not complicated.
	2) Goal should not be **how can I apply a pattern for this problem**, it should be these
		1) What is the problem?
		2) What needs to be simplified?
		3) Is there a pattern which solves the problem?
		4) if yes then does it need to be applied or will it make our design complicated.
		5) if no then how can we solve the problem?
2) Think of the bigger picture
3) You need it when...............
	1) Some aspects of a given system are bound to vary
4) Refactoring time is Patterns time
5) If you don't need it now, don't do it now
