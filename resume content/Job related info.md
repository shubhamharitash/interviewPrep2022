**Interview Process  
  
**To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.  

-   First Call with the founder (Remote):  
      
    

This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.  

-   Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):  
      
    

In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.  
  
The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.  
  
Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.  

-   Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):  
      
    

At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.  

-   Onboarding  
      
    

If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.  
  
In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.
